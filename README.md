# Tree-of-Thoughts-Replication
Tree-of-Thoughts-Replication provides a framework for deliberate problem solving by organizing intermediate reasoning steps (“thoughts”) into a tree structure. In this adaptation, it is applied to vision tasks, allowing exploration, evaluation, and backtracking over multiple visual hypotheses to improve decision making without additional training.
